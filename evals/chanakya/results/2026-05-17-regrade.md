# Chanakya activation eval — 2026-05-17 (grader v2)

- Candidate model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- Question set: 6 (3 invoke / 3 control)
- Corpus size: 76 verses

## Headline

- **Activation** (invoke + skill → exactly 1 in-corpus verse): **3/3 (100%)**
- **Discipline with skill loaded** (no invoke → no verse): **3/3 (100%)**
- **Attribution accuracy** — *new in v2 grader.* When the model is asked for Chanakya in plain English and produces a verse:
  - Without the skill loaded (baseline, training-data only):   0/3 verses in-corpus (0%)
  - With the skill loaded:   3/3 verses in-corpus (100%)

**Reading the attribution column:** for the `sabha` condition (no skill loaded), the model produces Chanakya verses from training-data knowledge when explicitly asked. The attribution column flags whether those cited verse numbers exist in our curated 76-verse corpus. Hallucinated = the cited number isn't in the corpus, so either the model invented a plausible-looking number, or it's a real verse outside our curated set.
