# Quickstart — get Sabha working in 10 minutes (no installation needed)

> **This guide is for you if** you've used Claude.ai (the website) but you've never installed software from GitHub, never used a terminal, and don't know what `git clone` means. You'll be up and running in under 10 minutes.

> **Setup time:** ~10 minutes
> **Required:** a free Claude.ai account
> **Optional (for advanced users later):** Claude Code, a memory MCP

---

## What you'll be able to do

After this quickstart, you'll have a personalized AI council inside Claude.ai. Every substantive question you ask will get answered by the right "role" — a CFO for money questions, a CMO for marketing, a CIO for tech, and so on. Each answers in a decisive, tradeoff-aware voice — no more five-options-to-consider replies.

### What you'll get (no-install path)

| Feature | Available |
|---|---|
| The Sabha routing protocol (Routing: CFO, etc.) | ✓ Yes |
| Decisive answers with named tradeoffs | ✓ Yes |
| Eight role personas (CFO, CMO, CIO, CSO, CXO, CHRO, CAIO, CEO) | ✓ Yes |
| Deep CFO and CMO frameworks (Kahneman, Christensen, Porter, etc.) | ✓ Yes (with extra paste — Step 6) |
| Personal / Developer council presets | ✓ Yes |
| Memory across sessions (your Sakthi compounds) | ✗ No — needs technical setup |
| Slash commands like `/engage` and `/route` | ✗ No — Claude Code only |

You get roughly **70% of Sabha's value** with no installation. The memory layer (the "Sakthi" that accumulates over months) is the part you'd add later if you want to go deeper.

---

## Step 1 — Open Claude.ai

In your web browser, go to **[claude.ai](https://claude.ai)** and sign in. If you don't have an account, sign up — the free tier is enough to try Sabha.

---

## Step 2 — Create a new Project

A Claude Project is a private workspace where you can give Claude permanent instructions. This is where Sabha lives.

1. Click the **Projects** icon in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Project** (or the "+ New Project" button).
3. Give it a name — e.g., *"My Sabha"* or *"My Council"*.
4. Click **Create**.

You'll land in the new Project. Look for a section called **"Custom instructions"**, **"Project knowledge"**, or **"Instructions"** — this is where you'll paste Sabha.

---

## Step 3 — Pick the right council for you

Sabha ships with three reference councils. Pick the one that fits what you'll use it for most:

| Council | Pick this if you're... | Roles included |
|---|---|---|
| **Professional** | Running a business, making company decisions | CFO, CMO, CIO, CSO, CXO, CHRO, CAIO, CEO |
| **Personal** | Making life decisions (health, money, family, career) | Health, Finance, Family, Career, Time, Self |
| **Developer** | Doing software / engineering work | Architect, Reviewer, Security, Performance, QA, Mentor, Tech Lead |

You can change your mind later or set up separate Projects for each. For your first try, pick the one that matches the biggest chunk of your work.

---

## Step 4 — Copy the council file from GitHub

Each council is a single file you copy as-is.

1. Open the council you picked (right-click → open in new tab):
   - **Professional:** [examples/professional-sakthi.CLAUDE.md](../examples/professional-sakthi.CLAUDE.md)
   - **Personal:** [examples/personal-sakthi.CLAUDE.md](../examples/personal-sakthi.CLAUDE.md)
   - **Developer:** [examples/developer-sakthi.CLAUDE.md](../examples/developer-sakthi.CLAUDE.md)

2. On the GitHub page, click the **"Raw"** button (top-right of the file view). The page will now show plain text.

3. Select all the text (`Cmd+A` on Mac, `Ctrl+A` on Windows) and copy it (`Cmd+C` / `Ctrl+C`).

---

## Step 5 — Paste it into your Claude Project

1. Go back to your Claude.ai Project.
2. Find the **Custom instructions** field.
3. Paste (`Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+V`).
4. Click **Save** (or the equivalent).

Your council is now active. Every conversation in this Project will use the Sabha protocol.

---

## Step 6 — Fill in YOUR context (the bracketed parts)

Look in the text you just pasted for a section called **"MEMORY"**. You'll see something like this:

```
PEOPLE:      [your name], [co-founder], [key teammate], [key contractor]
COMPANIES:   [your company], [parent entity], [subsidiary]
PRODUCTS:    [product 1], [product 2], [internal codename]
PROJECTS:    [active initiative], [upcoming launch], [bet you're tracking]
```

Replace the bracketed text with your actual people, companies, products, and projects.

**Why this matters:** these are the names Sabha will use as anchors. When you mention "Project X" in a question, the council knows X is a real thing in your world, not a typo.

**Example, filled in for a fictional founder:**

```
PEOPLE:      Alice (me), Bob (co-founder), Maya (engineering lead)
COMPANIES:   Acme Co. (my company)
PRODUCTS:    Acme Cloud (main product)
PROJECTS:    Q3 enterprise launch, customer-onboarding rewrite
```

Save the changes.

### Want the deep CFO / CMO frameworks too? (optional, recommended for professional council)

If you picked the **Professional** council and want the deep CFO/CMO knowledge layer (the frameworks from Kahneman, Christensen, Porter, McKinsey, etc.), do this:

1. Open these two files on GitHub:
   - [skills/roles/cfo/REFERENCE.md](../skills/roles/cfo/REFERENCE.md)
   - [skills/roles/cmo/REFERENCE.md](../skills/roles/cmo/REFERENCE.md)
2. For each: click **Raw**, select all, copy.
3. In your Claude Project, scroll to the bottom of the custom instructions.
4. Paste both — separate them with a blank line.
5. Save.

This gives your CFO and CMO roles access to detailed frameworks instead of just role descriptions. It's the difference between a generic advisor and an experienced one.

---

## Step 7 — Ask your first question

Start a new conversation inside the Project and ask something substantive — a real decision you're facing, not trivia.

**Try one of these to see Sabha work:**

For the **Professional** council:
> *"We have $200K in the bank, burn is $35K/month, and a competitor just shipped the feature we were planning. Should I hire another engineer to ship faster, or pivot the feature?"*

For the **Personal** council:
> *"I'm being offered a remote contract role at 20% more than my current salary but it means giving up the office community I love. How should I think about this?"*

For the **Developer** council:
> *"Our service is at 800ms p99 latency. Should I refactor the database queries or add a Redis cache layer first?"*

### What a good Sabha reply looks like

You should see something like this at the top:

```
Routing: CFO (primary). CSO weighs in on the competitive pressure.

[The recommendation in one or two sentences, with numbers]

[The tradeoff — what you give up]

[The next concrete move]
```

If you see the `Routing:` line — it's working. If you don't, jump to the troubleshooting section below.

---

## Step 8 — Use "ask" vs "engage" mode

Sabha has two modes built in:

| Mode | When to use it | How to trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Ask** (default) | Quick question, chat reply | Just ask normally |
| **Engage** | The decision matters enough to write down | Say *"file this as a memo"* or *"engage mode — write it up"* |

In **ask mode**, Claude gives you a tight inline answer.
In **engage mode**, Claude produces a document-grade write-up you can save, share, or come back to in 6 months.

**Use engage mode when:**
- The decision involves real money, time, or risk
- You'll want to remember the reasoning later
- You're sending the output to someone else (investor, partner, customer)

For everything else — stay in ask mode. The default is fast and conversational.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude isn't showing the `Routing:` line"

- Check that you saved the custom instructions in your Project. Some Claude.ai UIs require an explicit Save button after pasting.
- Make sure you started a **new conversation** after pasting — old conversations don't see new instructions.
- Verify the paste went through completely. Scroll to the bottom of the instructions; you should see *"github.com/rdmurugan/sabhaos"* at the very end. If not, the paste was cut off — try again.

### "Claude is still giving me five options to consider"

- Check the **ANSWER** section in the pasted instructions. It should say *"Decisive. Recommend, don't survey."* If it's missing, the paste was incomplete.
- Try asking a more concrete question. Sabha activates on **substantive** questions (decisions, tradeoffs, recommendations). It explicitly skips trivia, factual lookups, and chit-chat. "What's the weather?" won't route. "Should we hire X?" will.

### "It still doesn't know my project / people / company"

- Did you fill in the `[BRACKETS]` in the MEMORY section (Step 6)? If they still say `[your name]`, the council has nothing to anchor on.
- Each Project's memory is separate from other Projects. If you mention something in conversation, it lives in that conversation; it doesn't carry between Projects unless you also put it in the custom instructions.
- For memory that actually accumulates across sessions, you need a local memory MCP — that's the optional technical setup at the end.

### "The roles don't match my work"

- You probably want a different preset. Try the other councils (Personal / Developer). You can keep them in separate Projects.
- Or **customize** — open the council file, rename roles to match your situation. A consulting agency might rename CIO to "Creative Director." A researcher might use "Methodologist" instead of CAIO. Edit the role table; Claude will adapt.

### "I'm getting too much output"

- That's ask vs engage mode. If you accidentally triggered engage (by saying "write it up" or "draft a memo"), Claude is producing a doc-grade output. Just say *"keep it in ask mode"* and try again.

## When you're ready to go deeper

The no-install path covers ~70% of Sabha's value. If you find yourself using it daily, two next steps unlock the rest:

### Add memory (the "Sakthi" that compounds)

In a single conversation, Claude remembers what you told it. Across conversations, it forgets. To make memory accumulate over time, you install **MemPalace** — a local memory MCP that ships in the same marketplace as Sabha.

If you're already using Claude Code, three terminal commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add rdmurugan/sabhaos     # if not already added
claude plugin install mempalace@sabha-marketplace
uv tool install mempalace
# (alternative if you don't have uv: pip install mempalace)
```

The first two register the plugin and its MCP server config. The third installs the actual Python binary that runs the memory server.

After that, restart Claude Code. Sabha will detect MemPalace and start grounding answers in your accumulated Sakthi. Every decision and conversation can be filed into a searchable graph that lives entirely on your machine — nothing leaves.

**If you're not using Claude Code** (just Claude.ai web), you can't run MemPalace today — memory MCPs require a local runtime. Sabha still works in Claude.ai's web Project as described in earlier steps; you just don't get the cross-session compounding. Most non-technical users skip this step.

**Don't want MemPalace specifically?** Sabha is memory-MCP-agnostic. mem0, Letta, Zep, and Pieces all work with the same protocol. See [`docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md`](./CUSTOMIZATION.md) for swap instructions.

### Use Claude Code instead of Claude.ai

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) is the command-line version of Claude. It supports plugins (Sabha installs as one), slash commands (`/ask`, `/engage`, `/route`), and direct file operations. It's much faster for daily use once you're comfortable with a terminal.

If you want to make the jump, the [main README](../README.md) walks through the Claude Code installation path.
