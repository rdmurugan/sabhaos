**Reading the attribution column:** for the `sabha` condition (no skill loaded), the model produces Chanakya verses from training-data knowledge when explicitly asked. The attribution column flags whether those cited verse numbers exist in our curated 76-verse corpus. Hallucinated = the cited number isn't in the corpus, so either the model invented a plausible-looking number, or it's a real verse outside our curated set.
